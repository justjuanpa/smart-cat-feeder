# 🧠 AI Model (Facial Recognition)

This folder contains all files related to training, testing, and exporting the facial recognition model used in the **Milo & Mimi Smart Feeder**.

---

## 🎯 Goal

Train a lightweight model that can distinguish between **Milo** and **Mimi** using images captured from a camera.  
The trained model will later be used on the **Raspberry Pi** (inside the `feeder-device` folder) to decide whether the feeder should open.
